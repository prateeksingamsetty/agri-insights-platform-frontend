              This platform is designed to serve as a library of agricultural
              enterprise models held in one place. Currently, there are two
              commodities on the platform, such as dairy and tomatoes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dairy model provides a basic enterprise budget, a feed
              component and source tool, a greenhouse gas emissions calculator,
              and a methane digester feasibility report.

              The tomato model provides a basic enterprise budget and a weather
              dependent disease damage management model.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both commodities have relevant price data that is from the most
              recently available reports, citations for calculations, and
              additional resources that could provide the user with useful
              background.
